# Doze Studios

🚀 Exciting Project - "<b>Doze Studios</b>"! 🎉

I am thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project - <b>Doze Studios</b>! 🌟

<b>🎯 Project Details : </b> <br>

Doze Studios has been reimagined with a dynamic, cutting-edge visual experience. Using frame sequence animation and GSAP for smooth, scroll-triggered transitions, the website now offers a more immersive and engaging interaction. Every scroll uncovers a new visual layer, creating a seamless flow that captivates users and enhances the overall storytelling.

<b>💡 Key Features : </b><br>
✅ Frame Sequence Animation:  <br>
I’ve integrated an interactive animation using the Canvas API, where a series of images seamlessly transition as users scroll, bringing the content to life in a unique and engaging way.<br>

✅ GSAP Integration:  <br>
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is utilized to ensure smooth and sophisticated content transitions. This enhances user experience by giving the website a fluid, polished feel as users interact with the page.<br>

✅ Preloader: <br>
A custom-built preloader ensures that all media assets are fully loaded before the content is visible, providing a smooth and uninterrupted browsing experience.<br>

✅ Responsive Design:  <br>
The website is fully optimized for all screen sizes, ensuring that both the animation and content adjust perfectly to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.<br>

✅ Smooth Scrolling with Lenis:  <br>
Integrated Lenis for an ultra-smooth scrolling experience, which complements the visual transitions and adds a layer of elegance to the navigation.<br>
